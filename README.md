FishLight - An LED light for my fishtank.
Created by Mike Loptien in 2013 in Longmont Colorad
=========

This project is an Arduino project implementing an automatic lighting array for
my fish tank.  It automatically gets brighter for sunrise, dims for sunset, and
has a night function to allow me to see the nocturnal fish during the night.

This initially started out as a simple project with an Arduino from 
www.sparkfun.com, a set of (6x) Cool White, (6x) Warm White, and (5x)Royal Blue
LEDs from www.rapidled.com, some very large potentiometers for current control
from www.digikey.com, and some PWM control based on parts also from SparkFun.
However, this project quickly grew and obtained a 5 button directional pad and
a 14x2 character LCD display.

This project is somewhat of a prototype and I hope to design and build a custom
PCB in the near future to clean up the mess that is my project box.  I also
hope to clean up my code and make it more portable and object oriented.  I am
still a bit shaky on some of the concepts of OOP.
